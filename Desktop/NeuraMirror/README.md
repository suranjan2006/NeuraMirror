## 🎯 Problem Statement
Excessive screen time, social media usage, lack of sleep, and stress are silently affecting mental health.  
Users often don’t realize when they cross healthy digital limits.

---

## 💡 Solution
NeuraMirror analyzes daily digital habits and visually reflects the user’s mental state using:
- Interactive sliders
- AI-based scoring logic
- Animated AI characters (Lottie animations)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

NeuraMirror uses a simple yet effective AI-inspired logic to reflect a user’s digital mental state.

The user provides daily habit inputs using interactive sliders:
- Screen Time (hours/day)
- Social Media Usage (hours/day)
- Study / Work Hours
- Sleep Hours
- Stress Level (1–10)

Based on these inputs, the app calculates a **Digital Strain Score** using the formula:

### 🧮 AI Reflection Logic
- 🟢 **Healthy (Score < 10)**  
  The user maintains a balanced digital lifestyle.

- 🟡 **Warning (Score 10–17)**  
  The user is moving toward digital overload.

- 🔴 **Danger (Score ≥ 18)**  
  High digital strain detected. The user needs to reduce screen exposure and rest.

Each state is represented using an **animated AI character (Lottie animation)** that visually reflects the user’s mental condition.
